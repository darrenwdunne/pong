# pong
Classic pong in pure JavaScript

## Description
Uses the new HTML5 Canvas drawing capabilities to produce a real-time game, including:
- game loop
- mouse movement to control paddle
- hit detection, etc.. 

Simple AI on the computer's paddle, so that it's possible for the user to win occasionally ;-)
